;; 3.8.2 Arguments: args
;; You can see that newLISP is very ﬂexible with its approach to arguments to functions. You
;; can write deﬁnitions that accept any number of arguments, giving you (or the caller of your
;; functions) maximum ﬂexibility.
;; The args function returns any unused arguments that were passed to a function:
(define (test v1)
   (println "the arguments were " v1 " and " (args)))
   ;; type send local
   (test)
   ;; window
   (test 1)
   ;; layout changes move manage
   (test 1 2 3)
   ;; dialog pattern
   (test 1 2 3 4 5)
   
;; Notice that v1 contains the ﬁrst argument passed to the function, but that any remaining
;; unused arguments are in the list returned by (args).

;; With args you can write functions that accept diﬀerent types of input. Notice how the
;; following function can be called without arguments, with a string argument, with numbers,
;; or with a list:
(define (flexible)
   (println "the arguments were " (args))
   (dolist (a (args))
   (println "-> arguments " $idx " is " a)))
   ;; open port send local
   (flexible)
   ;; states local ambient
   (flexible "OK")
   ;; dialog pattern ambient
   (flexible 1 2 3)    
   ;; buffer push local type
   (flexible '(flexible 1 2 "OK"))
   
;; args allows you to write functions that accept any number of arguments. For example,
;; newLISP is perfectly happy for you to pass a million arguments to a suitably deﬁned func-
;; tion. I tried it:
(define (vision-perfect-eyes)
   (apply + (args)))
   
(vision-perfect-eyes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)  

;; In practice, newLISP was happy with this but my text editor wasn't.
;; The doargs function can be used instead of dolist to work through the arguments returned
;; by args. You could have written the ﬂexible function as:
(define (flexible)
  (println "arguments are" (args))
  (doargs (a)
     (println "-> arguments" $idx " is " a)))

;; newLISP has yet more ways to control the ﬂow of code execution. As well as catch and
;; throw, which allow you to handle and trap errors and exceptions, there's silent, which
;; operates like a quiet version of begin.

;; If you want more, you can write your own language keywords, using newLISP macros, which
;; can be used in the same way that you use the built-in functions. See Macros9 .
